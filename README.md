**Arcomua Lite** is a fork from Arcomua Modpack mainly designed to run the game effectively.

### Install

We highly recommend you install our pack via [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/arcomua-lite).

You can import Arcomua Modpack in HMCL/PCL2/BakaXL. Zip files shared on the website MCBBS using [MCBBS Modpack Format](https://www.mcbbs.net/thread-1247765-1-1.html). 

We made some video tutorials for [HMCL](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av438701520) or [PCL2/BakaXL](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av908952920) users. You can find them on Bilibili.

It should be noted that MultiMC and its fork version cannot support MCBBS Modpack Format. Therefore, it is only possible to use the Modrinth modpack format (.mrpack).

### Usage

You can launch it as a game version.
